In the beginning of my code, I call two variables count and color and set them to zero.  
In the main loop I just set stop watchdog timer and set up the voids.
In Led setup, I took 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 pins and made them outputs and conformed the registers.
In the Timer setup, I enabled the overflow, set the pwm period, reset the ccr1, set the ccr1 duty cycle and set up the clock
In the timer interrupt, the value count is increased twiced, then there is an if statement that filters throught the colors
If color is 0 it adds green
if the color is 1 it  stops red making green
if the color is 2 then adds blue to make cyan
if the color is 3 stops green making blue
if the color is 4 adds red to make purple
if the color os 5 it removes blue to make red
